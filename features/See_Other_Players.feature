Feature: See other players
  As a player of a card game
  I'd like to see other players number of cards
  so that I can think strategically about the game

  Background:
  # some players with specified amount of cards should be started

  Given I'm on the other-players page
#
#  Scenario: I am on the other-players page and see a player and their amount of cards
   Then I should see "testPlayer" with "3" cards
